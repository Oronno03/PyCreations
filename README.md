## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the relevant project folder** to explore the code.
3. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment** to keep dependencies isolated:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```
5. **Install the dependencies** listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the Python script directly using:
   ```bash
   python <category>\<script_name>.py
   ```
